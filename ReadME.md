Fundamentals of Object-oriented Programming and Discrete Structures (FOODPS) Activity Programs

This is a collection for all the programming activities of the AdDU-SHS FOODPS subject. With this, it will guide and explain the code presented as well as show how it works. This can be used to know the codes ahead of time, even also to practice said activities. 


FOODPS uses python3 and when trying any of the codes, copy it and paste it to any python3 IDE (Visual Studio, PyCharm, Python Command line), or use an online python compiler (OnlineGDB).


Since this is part of the assignments in this subject, it is highly recommended to change the variable names of the code so as to not promote plagiarism, although I don't particularly mind about it, it is still good practice to change it in a way that its different from source code.


Sharing of the codes and programs is widely accepted and recommended! Teaching more people about coding and how it can be simple and easy is great and linking this repository to others is much appreciated!
