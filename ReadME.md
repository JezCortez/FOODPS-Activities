# FOODPS-Activities
Fundamentals of Object-oriented Programming and Discrete Structures (FOODPS) Activity Programs

This is a collection for all the programming activities of the AdDU-SHS FOODPS subject. With this, it will guide and explain the code presented as well as show how it works. This can be used to know the codes ahead of time, even also to practice said activities. 


FOODPS uses python3 and when trying any of the codes, copy it and paste it to any python3 IDE like:
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)
- [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

or use an [online python compiler](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_python_compiler)


Since this is part of the assignments in this subject, it is highly recommended to change the variable names of the code so as to not promote plagiarism, although I don't particularly mind about it, it is still good practice to change it in a way that its different from source code.


Sharing of the codes and programs is widely accepted and linking this repository is much appreciated!

## Python Data Types
Here are some Data types that are going to be discussed in the FOODPS subject:
- **Integer**
- **Floating Point**
- **String**
- **List**
- **Dictionary**
- **Tuple**
- **Set**
- **Boolean**

#### Integer



## Activity #1: Hello world

`print` is one of the simplest and most used function in all of python programming, it allows the program to output anything like a message or an answer.

```python
print("Hello World")
```
In this case, the program will output `Hello World` when executed.

The `print` function has two parts:
The function itself
```python
print()
```
and the parameters
```python
("Hello World")
```
The function is straightforward, it calls for a function, in this case the `print` function to indicate that the program needs to output whatever is inside the parameters section

The parameters are what is to be outputted by the program, which is `"Hello World"`
